# 1. What is GECKO?
Gratitational-wave Electromagnetic-wave Counterpart in Korea Observatory (GECKO; [M. Im et al. (2019)](http://yokohamagrb2019.wikidot.com/proceedings)) project is aiming to find kilonovae (KNe), the optical/NIR counterpart of GW, with the network of 1-2m class telescopes in the world.

## 1.1. Facilties
Both projects share the same facilities. They consist of more than 10 telescopes described in below:

|Facility|Location|Description|

|LOAO       |USA         |TBD|
|LSGT       |Austrailia  |TBD|
|KCT        |Austrailia  |TBD|
|RASA36     |Chile       |TBD|
|CBNUO      |Korea       |TBD|
|KMTNet_SSO |Austrailia  |TBD|

# 2. Requirements
We recommand the following requirements about the version:
- This pipeline requires the version of Python == 3.11.3

**We highly recommend to use the state-of-the-art `Python >= 3.11` to maximize the computing speed.**

## 2.1. Python Library
- `numpy == 1.23.5`
- `scipy == 1.10.1`
- `matplotlib == 3.7.1`
- `astropy == 5.1`
- `astroscrappy == 1.1.0`
- `ccdproc == 2.4.0`
- `requests == 2.28.1`: To utilize slack API
- *`alipy`
<!-- - `PyRAF >= X` -->
